An SDE I is essentially a new and inexperienced (at the level of Amazon's engineers) junior engineer, usually a college hire.

SDE IIs have a few years of experience, including experience with large codebases and some architectural experience.

SDE IIIs have many years of experience, and have led or spearheaded at least one nontrivial or important project.

				SDE-1 are expected to solve any problems related to “Coding, Data structures, Algorithms, Problem Solving”

				SDE-2 are expected to solve what SDE-1 can solve + “Object Oriented Design, System design and architecture” + some leadership skills


		An experienced candidate should know his/her capability and skills and if they doubt themselves, it’s definitely not easy for an interviewer to trust their skills.

At first level you might be using someone else code and just doing modification.
At second level you might be reviewing other code.
Then next level you might be asked to write code from scratch level or act as lead and think from overall project perspective.
