Comparable vs Comparator
Iterator vs Enumerator
Where (in which situation) to use Set, HashMap, List
Java 8 streams, terminal methods, intermediate methods
how to convert a list to set, map to list, etc
Internal working of Collections (Eg. HashMap, size, load factor)
Optional interface, methods in it. (ispresent, ifpresent, ofnullable, orElse, orElsethrow, etc.) along with their return types
Flat map concept. in which scenario to use flatmaps
map() vs flatmap()
Fail fast iterator, fail safe iterator, concurrent modification exception

Topics to prepare

Java 8:
-         Streams
-         Lamda expressions
-         Optional interface
-         Flatmap, map
-         Terminal methods, intermediate methods
-         Default method
-         Functional interface
Collections:
-         Internal working of Collections (Eg.: HashMap), size, load factor
-         Which collection to use for a given scenario
-         Iterator (Fail fast, fail safe)
-         Comparator vs Comparable
Data Structures and Algorithms:
-         Sorting algorithms with time complexity
-         Searching algorithms with time complexity
-         Given a problem, you should be able to derive an optimal solution and analyze its time complexity
-         Data structures (LinkedList, Stack, Queue, Set, etc.) and its sample implementation (Eg. Inserting a node to a linkedlist)
Microservice:
-         Spring Boot topics
-         MVC Architecture
REST API
Hibernate



Like core java, and u have to come up with an optimal solution
